<para><blockquote><para>Rationals: </para></blockquote>It was decided to have only one SW unit for the entire module, because the overall complexity for this functionality <linebreak/>
is not very high, and the interaction between functions has a good comprehensibility. <linebreak/>
Also the splitting of the module in functions took in consideration the already defined interfaces on SWA level, the content <linebreak/>
 of the requirements valid for this component, and to have an easy to understand and maintainable code when implementing the SWDD. <linebreak/>
 <blockquote><para>Alternatives: </para></blockquote>Based on the type of data that have to be processed from RL78 the module could be splitted in more SW units. <linebreak/>
One main unit that contains the implementation of sending and receiving the DiagInfo data from RL78, <linebreak/>
and other SW units for HW version, DTC(s) setting and processing, CRC32 calculation, etc. <linebreak/>

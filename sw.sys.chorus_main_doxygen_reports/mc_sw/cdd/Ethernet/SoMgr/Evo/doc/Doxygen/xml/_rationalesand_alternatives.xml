<para><bold>Rationales:</bold> <linebreak/>
 SoMgr component is intended to provide a easier way to control the sockets and their data buffers.<linebreak/>
 Because of limited memory resources, SoMgr needs to provide the means to allocate and deallocate memory from a fixed length memory area, so the sockets will use the allocate/deallocate functionality to store the received/transmitted data.</para><para><bold>Alternatives:</bold> <linebreak/>
 Socket Manager is intended as a replacement of SoAd BSW module, as they require a lot of memory and some sort of dynamically memory handling.</para><para><bold>Constraints:</bold> <linebreak/>
 The integration of SoMgr in the Tcp/Ip context uses the interfaces described in <ref refid="_internal_component_design_1InternalComponentDesign" kindref="member">Internal Component Design</ref>. </para>    </detaileddescription>

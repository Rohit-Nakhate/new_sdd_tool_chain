<para><bold>Traceability - SWR and SWDD</bold> <linebreak/>
 The traceability between SWR and SWDD (model and implementation) is established on SW unit and function/code level by requirements identifier links. <linebreak/>
 Adapatations is composed of only one unit, namely Adapatations, which satisfies all requirements allocated to Adapatations within SWA. <linebreak/>
see <bold>Component Diagram &quot;Requirements traceability&quot;</bold> in SWA at the following location in Enterprise Architect: <linebreak/>
VW_ICVW_ICAS1.Chorus.All_Cores.SoftwareDecomposition.ComplexDeviceDrivers.ECU_DIAG_Chorus.Adaptations <linebreak/>
 <bold>Traceability - SWA and SWDD</bold> <linebreak/>
 The traceability between SWA and SWDD is established by using an identical component name.<linebreak/>
 <bold>Traceability - SWDD and Implementation</bold> <linebreak/>
 The traceability between SWDD and implementation is established by using identical sw unit names (in SWDD and implementation).<linebreak/>

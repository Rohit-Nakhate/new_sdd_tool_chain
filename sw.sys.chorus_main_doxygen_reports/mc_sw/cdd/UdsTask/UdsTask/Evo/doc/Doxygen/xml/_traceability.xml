<para><bold>Traceability - SWR and SWDD</bold> <linebreak/>
The traceability between SWR and SWDD (model and implementation) is established on SW unit and function/code level by requirements identifier links. <linebreak/>
&quot;UDSServiceHandler Integration&quot; component is only dealing with Task APIs, and the Task APIs are derived out from Architecture decisions. There are no SW requirements attached to it.</para><para>see <bold>Component Diagram &quot;Requirements traceability&quot;</bold> in SWA at the following location in Enterprise Architect: <linebreak/>

 The traceability between SWA and SWDD is established by using an identical component name.<linebreak/>
 <bold>Traceability - SWDD and Implementation</bold> <linebreak/>
 The traceability between SWDD and implementation is established by using identical sw unit names (in SWDD and implementation).<linebreak/>

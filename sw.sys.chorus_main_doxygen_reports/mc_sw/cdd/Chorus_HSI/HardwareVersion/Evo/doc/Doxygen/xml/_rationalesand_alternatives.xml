<para><bold>Rationales</bold>: The HardwareVersion component is split in 2 SW units (HardwareVersion and PostBuildHandler) because both are implementing different functionalities of this component. <linebreak/>
 HardwareVersion SW unit provides the HW version to other components that request it. PostBuildHandler SW unit provides PB configuration for components that request it. It can be noticed that both SW units are responsible for different functionalities. This split is done for a better organization, understanding and maintenance of the code. <linebreak/>
<bold>Alternatives</bold>: Both SW unit are not big units. They are only doing the needed functionality and no alternatives can be found. <linebreak/>

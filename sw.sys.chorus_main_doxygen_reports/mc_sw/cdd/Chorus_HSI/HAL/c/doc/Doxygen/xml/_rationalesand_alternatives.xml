<para><bold>Rationales</bold>: The HAL component is split in SW Units (hal_base, hal_common, hal_variant, gw_dev_msg, hal, hal_cfg, hal_cfg_gen, hal_defines_gen) because all of them are implementing different functionalities of this component. <linebreak/>
These SW units provides informations or functions needed by each others (e.g. HAL Base is needed by HAL Variant to set CAN/LIN to normal/sleep mode). <linebreak/>
This split is done for a better organization, understanding and maintenance of the code. <linebreak/>
 <bold>Alternatives</bold>: SW Units are not big units. They are only doing the needed functionality and no alternatives can be found. <linebreak/>

<para>The configuration file of RteLight is located in the RteLight\{Variant}.xml <linebreak/>
The architect needs to update information like the list of cores, and networks.<linebreak/>
The data stored there have to be aligned with BSW integrators as well as with Routintg engine team.<linebreak/>
 In order to generate the rte code the integrator just needs to run the <bold>build.bat</bold> without any parameters from the RteLight/RteTool/(1/Evo)/tools folder.<linebreak/>
However in order to configure an SWC in the RteLight several steps are required.<linebreak/>
Step 0 - Clone the SWC is not already done.<linebreak/>
 Step 1. - Map the XSDs to the correct SST tabs<linebreak/>
 Step 2. - Export to XML<linebreak/>
 Step 3. - Adapt the TEMPLATE_NameTransformation.xml<linebreak/>
 Step 4. - Adapt the TEMPLATE_SwcConfig.xml<linebreak/>
</para><para>Once the steps described above are realied, the integrator just needs to run the build.bat. Please do not forget: check in ALL the files you have changed durring the generation.<linebreak/>
 In order to shorten the time to integrate a new SWC, it is possible to &quot;clone&quot; an SWC template.<linebreak/>
To do so the integrator has to run the <bold>swcInitalDeploy.py</bold> from <emphasis>sw.sys.chorus_main_doc/mc_sw/RteLight/SwcTemplate/c/tools</emphasis>.<linebreak/>
An &quot;in tool help&quot; is already avaiable and maintained there. The options are available by running the tool without parameters.<linebreak/>

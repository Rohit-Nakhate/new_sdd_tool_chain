<para><bold>Traceability - SWR and SWDD</bold> <linebreak/>
The traceability between SWR and SWDD (model and implementation) is established on SW unit and function/code level by requirements identifier links. <linebreak/>
 The overview of the requirements allocation on file level can be found on the ExportedDoorsSpecification_0_requirements page. <linebreak/>
The overview of the requirements allocation on function level can be found on the Requirement Implementation page. <linebreak/>
 Invalid and outdated requirements were not imported to this documentation. It was done to avoid misleading information about not satisfied requirements.</para><para><linebreak/>
 <bold>Traceability - SWA and SWDD</bold> <linebreak/>
The traceability between SWA and SWDD is established by collecting all fuctions dedicated to serve the role of Active Participant in one library called &quot;BAPHandler_PSO_ImExport&quot;.</para><para><linebreak/>
 <bold>Traceability - SWDD and Implementation</bold> <linebreak/>
The traceability between SWDD and implementation is established by using identical sw unit names (in SWDD and implementation).<linebreak/>

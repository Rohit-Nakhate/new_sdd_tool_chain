<para>Many BAPHandler SWCs are acting as Active Participant and handling PSO_ImExport functionality, they are working in specific areas in exactly the same manner. The only difference is the data to handle and functions to call valid for specific BAPHandler SWC. Because of this two possible solutions were identified to be used in design.<linebreak/>
</para><para>Solution one would be to implement Active Participant functionality and handling of PSO_ImExport functionality separately in each specific BAPHandler SWC. By such approach code will be completely integrated with relevant SWC and will be better optimalized with it, but more time consuming in case of update and/or maintenance. <linebreak/>
</para><para>Opposite solution will be to prepare common code responsible for handling Active Participant and PSO_ImExport functionalities to be used by each needing it SWC. Such solution will be less optimalized per specific SWC because have to be universal, but the same time would be much more flexible and much easier to update and maintenance. <linebreak/>
</para><para>Finally second solution was chosen and implemented. Common solution was implemented as BAP_Chorus base library. <linebreak/>

<para>The resource consumption cannot be explicitly defined for BAPHandler_PSO_ImExport and BAPHandler_UtilityLib libraries. <linebreak/>
Potential influence on specific resource consumption should be considered from the perspective of specific SWC which is using functions from these libraries. <linebreak/>
 The library BAPHandler_PSO_ImExport serve the Active Participant functionality and handle PSO_ImExport functionality, what influence in recognized manner on resource consumption, but should be considered as a part of resource consuption of specific SWC which is using this library (as was reflected in SWA in relevant architecture decision).</para><para>The library BAPHandler_UtilityLib collects simple helper funtions which has minimal impact on performance, memory consumption or CPU Load and also should be considered as a part of resource consuption of specific SWC which is using this library. <linebreak/>

 The performance objectives were not defined for these libraries and are not mentioned in the SWA.</para><para><bold>Memory Consumption:</bold> <linebreak/>

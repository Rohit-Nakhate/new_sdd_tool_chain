</para><para>This document contains the Software Detailed Design documentation for BAP base libraries used by BAPHandler SWC&apos;s in project ICAS1. <linebreak/>
</para><para>The BAP base library BAPHandler_PSO_ImExport handle personalisation functionality for BAPHandler SWC&apos;s. <linebreak/>
</para><para>The BAP base library BAPHandler_UtilityLib includes universal, common functions which can be used by any SWC if needed. <linebreak/>
</para><para><heading level="2">Document Scope </heading>
</para><para>The main purpose of this document is to describe the software detailed design of the BAP base library &quot;BAPHandler_PSO_ImExport&quot; as defined <linebreak/>
in the SWA along with all allocated SWRs valid for Active Participant functionality. <linebreak/>
</para><para>Additionally it describes the software detailed design of the &quot;BAPHandler_UtilityLib&quot; unit. <linebreak/>
However in this case description is limited only to Doxygene description of the defines, enums, types and functions with uml diagrams collected in this unit. <linebreak/>
There is not sepcific SWA nor SWR&apos;s defined for this library. No static or dynamic bahavior was defined for this library. <linebreak/>
</para><para>Design elements for requirements only partially allocated to this component will only cover that part. <linebreak/>

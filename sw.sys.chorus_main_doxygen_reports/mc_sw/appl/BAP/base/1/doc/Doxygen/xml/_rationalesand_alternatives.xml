<para>Many BAPHandler SWC acting as Active Participant and handling PSO_ImExport functionality, they are working in specific areas in exactly the same manner. The only difference is the data to handle and functions to call valid for specific BAPHandler SWC. Because of this two possible sollutions were identified to be used in design.<linebreak/>
</para><para>Sollution one will be to implement Active Participant functionality and handling of PSO_ImExport functionality separately in each specific BAPHandler SWC. By such approach code will be completely integrated with relevant SWC and will be better optimalized with it, but more time consuming on case of updated and/or maintenance. <linebreak/>
</para><para>Oposite sollution will be to prepare common code responsible for handling Active Participant and PSO_ImExport functionalities to be used by each needing it SWC. Such sollution will be less optimalized per specific SWC because have to be unversal, but the same time will me much more flexible and much easier to updated and maintenance. <linebreak/>
</para><para>Finally second sollution was chosens and implemented. Common sollution was implemented as BAP_Chorus base libraries. <linebreak/>

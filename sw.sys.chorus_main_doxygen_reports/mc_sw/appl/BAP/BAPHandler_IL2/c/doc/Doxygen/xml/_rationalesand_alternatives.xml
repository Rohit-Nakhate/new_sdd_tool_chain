<para>Because each BAP Handler acting as Active Participant is working in the same way and only difference is the data to handle and functions to call, <linebreak/>
the most flexible and easy to maintenance solution was chosen. <linebreak/>
Single BAPHandler_ATN module was designed to provide couple functions which allow each BAPHandler to act as Active Participant in communication with OCU. <linebreak/>
In practice is not a module but rather a library providing Active Participant functionality. <linebreak/>
 Creating separate ATN module for each BAPHandler was considered and discarded as more prone to errors and more difficult to maintain. </para>    </detaileddescription>

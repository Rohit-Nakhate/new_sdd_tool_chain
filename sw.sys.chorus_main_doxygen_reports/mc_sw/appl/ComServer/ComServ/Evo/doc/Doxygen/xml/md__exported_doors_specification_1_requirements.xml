The elements that are defined as optional in the data specification and marked as &quot;unavailable&quot; by the application must be skipped and must not be serialized. <linebreak/>
 <linebreak/>
 Note1: An element of a structure can be either required or optional. In the first case, the element must be always transmitted by the sender; in the last case, the element is transmitted only on request. If there are not any available optional elements, the receiver must ensure the processing. <linebreak/>
 Note2: the application marks the elements as &quot;unavailable&quot; in a specific way for each implementation <linebreak/>
 Note3: By using a tag/length/value coding, the length of the serialized byte stream is of course increased and leads to an increased complexity, so that the processing time of the serializer and the deserializer also rises. <linebreak/>

As already specified in SWR_ICAS1_GW_3670 and SWR_ICAS1_GW_3669, for each data structure that needs to be serialized, a Length Indicator of 4 bytes needs to be added at the begining of each strucutre. <linebreak/>

Due to static configuration of the services, which is defined in the data specification, the same size of the Length Indicator (4 bytes) needs to be used for all elements of a message (structures, unions, arrays). This size needs to be used for Serialization and also Deserialization. <linebreak/>
 <linebreak/>
 Note: This req is appplicable for wire type 4. For this wire type the Length Indicator size should be defined in the ComServer_Spec files, but is not. Due to this, the decision was to use the 4 bytes Length Indicator for this wire type. <linebreak/>

As specified in SWR_ICAS1_GW_3702 each element of a structure, needs to be preceeded by a tag. <linebreak/>
 This tag must be two bytes long and should consist of: <linebreak/>
 reserved (bit 7 of the first byte) <linebreak/>
 wire type (bit 6-4 of the first byte) <linebreak/>
 data ID (bit 3-0 of the first byte and bit 7-0 of the second byte) <linebreak/>
 <linebreak/>
 <linebreak/>
 <linebreak/>
 Note: Because 12 bits are used for the coding of data ID, 4095 is the highest possible value of a data ID and, thus, the highest possible number for the elements of a structure. <linebreak/>

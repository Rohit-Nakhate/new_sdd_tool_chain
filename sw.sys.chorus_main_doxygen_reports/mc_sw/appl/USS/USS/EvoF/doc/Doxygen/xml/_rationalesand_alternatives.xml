<para>USS uses dataset and was scheduled from Models task on core0. <linebreak/>
ModelsTask suspended the cyclic function while dataset download. <linebreak/>
According to the customer USS is no more safety relevant. <linebreak/>
After the new scheduler integration USS is still kept in Core0 , task: SchM_ICAS1_Main_C0. (historical reason) <linebreak/>
There were no alternatives considered as project uses AUTOSAR and most design is created to fit standards. </para>    </detaileddescription>

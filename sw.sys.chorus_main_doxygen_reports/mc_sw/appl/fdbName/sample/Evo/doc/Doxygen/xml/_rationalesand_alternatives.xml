<para>ICASEvo is using RteLight and integration code since the projects are not full AUTOSAR. If full AUTOSAR would be used, the library would have the runnables directly called from the scheduler and the library would have to call directly the NvM component in order to read/write the NVM blocks needed. </para>    </detaileddescription>

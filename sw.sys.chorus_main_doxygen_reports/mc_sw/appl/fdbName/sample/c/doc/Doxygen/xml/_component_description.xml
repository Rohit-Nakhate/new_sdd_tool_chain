<para>The Alcohol Interlock SW prenvents the drive from being started if the breath test of the driver is not passed. This ensures that the vehicle cannot move by its own forces. The actual implementation is made by means of an additional interface in the terminal control. This interface allows the terminal control to switch on Klemme 15 or not. The interfaces are connected to a breathing alcohol meter. Via the interface in the clamp control, vehicle activation with recognized breath alcohol is to be prevented.</para><para>Integration of the SW component is being done in <bold>Chorus, Core 0</bold>.</para><para>Evaluation of Software Detailed Design <linebreak/>
